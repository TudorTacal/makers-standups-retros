## Stand-ups & Retros
---------------

A web application aimed at remote teams to contribute to their Agile workflow. Hold standups and retros in real time. Makers Academy final project.

#### Introduction

This two-week group project was inspired by our Agile working practises at Makers Academy as well as our desire to continue motivating each other and collaborating on side projects after the course.

We set out to create a web app that would make it easy for remote workers to organise standups and retros with their team, would allow them to communicate and collaborate in real time, and would provide a fun and engaging user experience.

We chose to work with the MERN stack for this project, as we believed these would be the best tools for the job. We also integrated websockets for real time communication. This was a big challenge for us as a team as we had not yet experienced these technologies. Managing the flow of data within a standup/retro whilst allowing multiple unrelated standups/retros to take place at once was particularly challenging.
